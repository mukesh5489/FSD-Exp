Full Stack Learning Platform
The project is a web-based platform aimed at guiding users through structured learning paths for programming languages and web development technologies. It includes interactive roadmaps, quizzes, and resources to help users build their skills step-by-step.

Key Features:
Interactive Roadmaps:

Each programming language or technology (e.g., C, C++, Java, Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript) has a dedicated roadmap.
The roadmaps are divided into daily learning goals with links to external resources (e.g., YouTube tutorials, W3Schools, MDN).
Quizzes:

After completing a roadmap, users can take quizzes to test their knowledge.
Quizzes are interactive and provide feedback based on the user's score.
Dynamic Navigation:

Users can navigate between different roadmaps and topics using buttons and links.
The platform includes a home page with options to explore topics like Wikipedia, Sports, Timetable, and Programming Languages.
Progress Tracking:

Users can mark topics as completed using checkboxes.
The "Take Quiz" button becomes enabled only after all topics in a roadmap are marked as completed.
Responsive Design:

The platform is styled with modern CSS, ensuring a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.
Features like hover effects, animations, and transitions enhance the user experience.
Resource Integration:

External resources like YouTube videos, W3Schools, and MDN are integrated for in-depth learning.
Technologies Used:
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Backend: Not explicitly mentioned, but could be added for dynamic features.
File Structure:
templates: Contains HTML files for roadmaps and quizzes.
img: Stores images like logos.
index.html: Serves as the home page.
